# Installing Aleph-VM on a server / Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa (Deprecated) 

Support for Ubuntu 20.04 was due to compatibility issues with
the NFTables firewall introduced in version 
[0.2.6](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-vm/releases/tag/0.2.6).

We recommend upgrading to the newest Ubuntu LTS version 
and then use the 
[following instructions on Ubuntu 22.04](./INSTALL-Ubuntu-22.04.md)
).
